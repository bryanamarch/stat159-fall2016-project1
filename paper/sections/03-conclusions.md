#Concluding Remarks
The html file is the final result of the project. This project is an example of how to create a simple reproducible project. The tools and steps outlined are the ones I took to create this project, but there are many variations. Although the point of reproducible research is to recreate, it also instructive to innovate. Perhaps there are more interesting and easier to follow ways in which this project can be made. If you find this to be true, I would encourage you to make your own version.
This project was done for the purposes of Stat 159, an undergraduate statistics class taught at UC Berkeley by Professor Gaston Sanchez. Here is the Stat 159 logo:
