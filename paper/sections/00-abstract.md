#Project 1

##Abstract 
This project is an example of a reproducible research. In this project I look at how to describe the process of making a project that can be easily reproduced. I do this by using tools such as make, pandoc, git, and markup. These tools are fairly simple to use and some such as git allow you to track any changes you have made to your project so that you have a reference if you attempt to reproduce. This project may be used as a reference for completing your own reproducible research.
